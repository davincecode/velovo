                ### **4. Your Use of the Service: General Terms and Conditions**

                License to Use the Service. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable and revocable
                license to use the Service – subject to the Terms and the following restrictions in particular:

                A. You agree that you will not violate any laws in connection with your use of the Service. This
                includes any local, state, federal, and international laws that may apply to you. It is your
                responsibility to obtain any permits or licenses that you require. You may not commit fraud, theft or
                any crimes against Spoked, another Spoked user, or a third party.

                B. You are responsible for paying all fees that you owe Spoked. You are solely responsible for
                collecting and/or paying any applicable taxes for any purchases you make through the Service.

                C. The Service contains content owned or licensed by Spoked ("Spoked Content"). Spoked Content is
                protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between you and Spoked,
                Spoked owns and retains all rights in the Spoked Content and the Service. You will not remove, alter or
                conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or
                accompanying the Spoked Content and you will not reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works
                based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit
                the Spoked Content.

                D. The Spoked name and logo are trademarks of Spoked, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole
                or in part, without the prior written permission of Spoked, except in accordance with our brand
                guidelines. In addition, all page headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks,
                trademarks and/or trade dress of Spoked, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part,
                without prior written permission from Spoked.

                E. Although it is Spoked’s intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be
                occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance
                or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and/or equipment.
                Spoked reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any reason, without prior notice.
                Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by Spoked, including, without limitation, in
                order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order.
                Consequently, Spoked encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, Spoked
                is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content
                backup or storage. Spoked will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation
                of the Service, or the loss of any Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to
                breaches of security and that the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.

                F. You agree that Spoked is not responsible for, and does not endorse Content posted within the Service.
                Spoked does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content. If Your Content
                violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.

                G. It is Spoked’s policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other
                materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,
                conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are similar
                to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Spoked does not accept
                unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so transmitted.
                If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions, or other
                materials, you further agree that Spoked is free to use any such content, information, ideas,
                suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing
                and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.

                H. There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to
                third-party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in
                images or comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not
                control, maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the
                Service and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your
                profile on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a
                feature that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may
                be publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically
                requires you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Spoked
                does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly
                acknowledge and agree that Spoked is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party services
                or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE
                SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk,
                to use applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service
                (each, an "Application") and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull
                information from and to your Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to
                the following: (i) if you use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information
                about your profile on the Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally
                identifying information to be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Spoked has not
                itself provided such information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk,
                and you will hold the Spoked Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.

                I. You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.

                J. Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and
                promotions, and you hereby agree that Spoked may place such advertising and promotions on the Service or
                on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such advertising and
                promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.

                K. You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial
                communications as such.

                L. You acknowledge that Spoked and the Service are in no way affiliated with, sponsors of, nor maintain
                any partnerships with any registered trademarks or third-party organizations unless expressly stated by
                said third-party organization.

                ## **6. Reporting Copyright and Other IP Violations**

                Spoked respects the intellectual property rights of others and requires those that use the Service do
                the same. Spoked may, in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, remove or disable access to
                Content on the Service that infringes upon the copyright rights of others. Spoked also may, at our
                discretion, remove or disable links or references to an online location that contains infringing
                material or infringing activity. In the event that any users of the Service repeatedly infringe on
                others' copyrights, Spoked may in its sole discretion, terminate those individuals' rights to use the
                Service.

                If you believe that your work has been used on the Service in a manner that constitutes copyright
                infringement, please notify Spoked's copyright agent by written notice. The notice should include the
                following information:

                · An electronic or physical signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the
                copyright allegedly infringed;

                · A description of the copyrighted work you claim has been infringed, including a copy of the
                copyrighted work or the web page address where the copyrighted work may be found;

                · Identification of the specific location on the Service of the material you claim has been infringed,
                or the link or reference to another website that contains the material you claim has been infringed;

                · Your name, address, telephone number and email address;

                · A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use of the material at issue is
                not authorized by the copyright owner, the agent of the copyright owner, or the law; and

                · A statement by you that the information in the notification is accurate and a statement, under penalty
                of perjury, that you are the copyright owner of the material allegedly infringed or authorized to act on
                the copyright owner's behalf.

                Some jurisdictions limit or do not allow the disclaimer of implied or other warranties so the above

                Service; (b) the Spoked Content; (c) User Content; (d) your use of, inability to use, or the performance
                of the Service; (e) any action taken in connection with an investigation by the Spoked Parties or Law

                damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, loss of data, work stoppage, accuracy of results, or
                computer failure or malfunction, even if foreseeable or even if the Spoked Parties have been advised of
                or should have known of the possibility of such damages, whether in an action of contract, negligence,
                strict liability or tort (including, without limitation, whether caused in whole or in part by
                negligence, acts of god, telecommunications failure, or theft or destruction of the Service). In no
                event will the Spoked Parties be liable to you or anyone else for loss, damage or injury, including,
                without limitation, death or personal injury. In no event will the Spoked Parties total liability to you
                for all damages, losses or causes or action exceed one hundred British Pounds (£100.00).

                You agree that in the event you incur any damages, losses or injuries that arise out of Spoked's acts or
                omissions, the damages, if any, caused to you are not irreparable or sufficient to entitle you to an
                injunction preventing any exploitation of any web site, service, property, product or other content
                owned or controlled by the Spoked Parties, and you will have no rights to enjoin or restrain the
                development, production, distribution, advertising, exhibition or exploitation of any web site,
                property, product, service, or other content owned or controlled by the Spoked Parties.

                release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and
                unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties.

                ## **8. Indemnification**

                You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the service) agree to
                defend (at Spoked's request), indemnify and hold the Spoked Parties harmless from and against any
                claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's
                fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result
                of your direct activities on the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) Your Content or your
                access to or use of the Service; (ii) your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your
                violation of any third-party right, including without limitation, any intellectual property right,
                publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of any laws, rules,
                regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-governmental
                authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities;
                or (v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Spoked in the defense
                of any claim. Spoked reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter

                written consent of Spoked.

                Time limitation on claims.

                You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Spoked must be

                Governing Law.

                These Terms and the use of any Service from Screen Time shall be governed by and construed in accordance
                with the laws of England and Wales and will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of
                England and Wales.

                ## **9. Entire Agreement**

                If you are using the service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter
                into an agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These terms of use constitute the entire agreement
                between you and Spoked and governs your use of the service, superseding any prior agreements between you
                and Spoked. You will not assign the terms of use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations
                hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written
                consent of Spoked. any purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written
                consent of Spoked will be null and void. Spoked may assign these terms of use or any rights hereunder
                without your consent. If any provision of these terms of use is found by a court of competent
                jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion
                will be deemed severable from these terms of use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of
                the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the terms of use remain in full force and
                effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the
                terms of use. These terms of use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.

                ## **10. Changes to the Terms**

                At our sole discretion, we may update these Terms from time to time, if we believe that the changes are
                material. We may let you know by doing one (or more) of the following: (1) posting the changes through
                the Service or (2) sending you an email or message about the changes. That way you can decide whether
                you want to continue using the Service. Changes will be effective upon the posting of the changes. You
                are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any changes. Your use of the Service following
                the changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.

                ## **11. Finer Legal Points**

                If any provision of these the Terms of use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable
                during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable
                from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
                Spoked's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these terms will not
                be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these terms will be deemed a
                further or continuing waiver of such Term or Condition or any other Term or Condition. Spoked reserves
                the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes
                arising before the effective date of the amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the
                termination of any or all of your transactions with Spoked. If you have any questions about the Terms,
